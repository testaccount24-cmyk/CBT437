Notes on our copy of NODSI from Jan Jaeger.

Mod to not require RACF authorization for this program.

You still need the program to be APF-authorized.

We commented out the branch on the bad return code from the
RACROUTE.  Now the program doesn't need RACF authorization the
way we have it.  It works in any case, and you don't have to have
READ access to profile NODSI in the FACILITY class.  If you want
that, just uncomment the line that is the branch to AUTHERR.

Or the opposite.  If it is commented, and you do want to
require RACF authorization, then uncomment it.

*        BNZ   AUTHERR                       TEST

Cool tool........

Or alternatively, zap an existing NODSI module that requires RACF:
(Or reverse the zap if you want to restore the RACF requirement.)

//*
//*    ZAP NODSI TO NOT REQUIRE RACF AUTHORIZATION TO WORK.
//*
//SPZAP   EXEC PGM=AMASPZAP
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSLIB   DD  DSN=SYS1.W$$.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
